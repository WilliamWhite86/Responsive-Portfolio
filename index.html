      <p class=firstPara>The next one to write the great american novel. The one to define our generation. That was me
        growing up. At least ever since my 6th grade English
        teacher told me she'd be signing my book some day. I'd re-written part of <a class="textLink"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Cave" target="_blank">The Crystal Cave</a> for a book report. It was during my
        first weird period of binge reading.
      </p>
      <p>I'd go on to get my undergrad in 2009 - an english degree from UMaine Orono.</p>
      <p>It didn't pay anything - I wrote sporatically less and less. Any goal or direction never begun. Still... deep down I knew it was really my own fault. My
        failure. My limitation. Eventually I became bitter. I stopped reading.
      </p>
      <p>I've found my career. I like what I've learned - coding is fun and meaningful.</p>
