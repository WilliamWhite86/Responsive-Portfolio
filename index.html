      <p class=firstPara>The next one to write the great american novel. The one to define our generation. That was me
        growing up. At least ever since my 6th grade English
        teacher told me she'd be signing my book some day. I'd re-written part of <a class="textLink"
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crystal_Cave" target="_blank">The Crystal Cave</a> for a book report. It was during my
        first weird period of binge reading.
      </p>
      <p>I'd go on to get my undergrad in 2009 - an english degree from UMaine Orono. Figured brushing shoulders with
        Stephen
        King's teachers might rub off some of the magic - that my love for books made it worth shelling out the loans
        I'm still paying</p>
      <p>It didn't pay anything - I wrote sporatically less and less. Any goal or direction began to fade. Meanwhile,
        the degree didn't help me
        get a job - or really help me
        do
        anything at all. Still... deep down I knew it was really my own fault. It was my own laziness and lack of
        creativity - my
        limited intellect. My
        failure. My limitation. Eventually I became bitter. I stopped reading. I still binge a book here and there, but
        I have too many things to do and learn. My father always said that reading was for lazy people, but sometimes I
        think
        he said that because my mother read so much.
      </p>
      <p>For 2 years I struggled, convinced it'd come find me. That some manic-fueled surge would push out everything
        I've ever want to say. Instead, I stumbled from a political internhip, to the census, to camp counselor, to
        cashier.
      </p>
      <p>The fridid, bleak winter of 2011 was when I found myself unemployed. My now-wife ready to leave me, no money,
        no
        self-esteem. I drank a lot that winter - also wrote the most I ever had. But that ego of mine always kept me
        from submitting to publishers. And still - I needed money.
        Desperate, I called up a temp staffing agency, and that's when I began my career
        at Liberty. Since April 2011, I've worked my way in and up at Liberty. Right now I'm working in Legal IT. I may
        have given up on writing,
        but I've found my career and I'm making money. I may have given up my soul, but I have a family now. My boss is
        giving me this bootcamp - this chance - to do something better every day. I like what coding I've learned at
        work, and I want to get paid to do it. Writing was too damn boring anyway.</p>
